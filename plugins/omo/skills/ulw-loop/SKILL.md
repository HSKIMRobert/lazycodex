## Codex Harness Tool Compatibility

This skill may include examples copied from the OpenCode harness. In Codex, do not call OpenCode-only tools such as `call_omo_agent(...)`, `task(...)`, `background_output(...)`, or `team_*(...)` literally. Translate those examples to Codex native tools:

| OpenCode example | Codex tool to use |
| --- | --- |
| `call_omo_agent(subagent_type="explore", ...)` | `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as an explorer. ...","agent_type":"explorer","fork_context":false})` |
| `call_omo_agent(subagent_type="librarian", ...)` | `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as a librarian. ...","agent_type":"librarian","fork_context":false})` |
| `task(subagent_type="plan", ...)` | `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as a planning agent. ...","agent_type":"plan","fork_context":false})` |
| `task(subagent_type="oracle", ...)` for final verification | By default, record a self-review in the notepad: re-read the diff, run diagnostics, and capture evidence for every acceptance criterion. Only when the user demanded strict, rigorous, or high-accuracy review, use `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as a rigorous reviewer. ...","agent_type":"lazycodex-gate-reviewer","fork_context":false})`; include `fork_context: false`. |
| `task(category="...", ...)` for implementation or QA | `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({"message":"TASK: act as an implementation or QA worker. ...","fork_context":false})` |
| `background_output(task_id="...")` | `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent(...)` for mailbox signals |
| `team_*(...)` | Use Codex native subagents via `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` and `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent`; use `multi_agent_v1.send_input` and `multi_agent_v1.close_agent` only when exposed in the active tools list |

Role-specific behavior must be described in a self-contained `message`. Use `fork_context: false` to start the child with only the initial prompt (no parent history); use `fork_context: true` only when full parent history is truly required. Include any required conversation context, files, diffs, constraints, and requested skill names directly in the spawned agent's `message`. OMO installs these selectable agent roles into `~/.codex/agents/`: `explorer`, `librarian`, `plan`, `momus`, `metis`, `lazycodex-code-reviewer`, `lazycodex-qa-executor`, and `lazycodex-gate-reviewer` - pass the matching name as `agent_type` so the child gets that role's model and instructions. If the spawn tool exposes no `agent_type` parameter, omit it and describe the role inside `message`. If a code block below conflicts with this section, this section wins.

Codex exposes ONE of two subagent tool surfaces per session; check your own tool list and route accordingly. If `multi_agent_v1.*` tools exist, use the table above as written. If instead a flat `spawn_agent` with a required `task_name` exists (`multi_agent_v2`), rewrite every `multi_agent_v1.*` example: `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({...,"fork_context":false})` becomes `spawn_agent({"task_name":"<lowercase_digits_underscores>","message":...,"agent_type":...,"fork_turns":"none"})` (`"all"` only when full parent history is truly required); `send_input` becomes `send_message`; do not call `close_agent`/`resume_agent` (finished agents end on their own; `followup_task` re-tasks one, `interrupt_agent` stops one); `wait_agent` takes only `timeout_ms` and returns on any child mailbox activity. On the v2 surface `agent_type` may be ABSENT from the spawn schema (verified 2026-07-11: only `fork_turns`/`message`/`task_name`) — when absent, omit it and describe the role inside `message`; installed role TOMLs cannot be selected on that surface. If a code block below conflicts with this section, this section wins. `fork_context` is rejected on `multi_agent_v2` (`fork_context is not supported in MultiAgentV2; use fork_turns instead`).

When translating `load_skills=[...]`, include the requested skill names in the spawned agent's `message`. If a code block below conflicts with this section, this section wins.

Omit optional keys you do not set. Never send `items: []`, `message: ""`, `model: ""`, `reasoning_effort: ""`, or `service_tier: ""` — Codex rejects them (`Items can't be empty`, `reasoning_effort must not be empty`).

For work likely to exceed one wait cycle, require the child to send `WORKING: <task> - <current phase>` before long passes and `BLOCKED: <reason>` only when progress stops. A `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent` timeout only means no new mailbox update arrived; back off between waits (double the timeout up to ~5 minutes) instead of spinning short cycles. Treat a running child as alive. Fallback only when the child is completed without the deliverable, ack-only after followup, explicitly `BLOCKED:`, or no longer running.

# ulw-loop

Use this skill when the user asks for `ulw-loop`, `ulw`, durable goal execution, evidence-led work, manual QA, or checkpointed long-running delivery.

This skill is intentionally compact. The full workflow lives in `references/full-workflow.md`. Read only the sections needed for the current phase, then execute them exactly.

## Required First Steps

1. Open `references/full-workflow.md`.
2. Read through **Bootstrap** (including its tier triage), **Execution Loop**, the **Manual-QA channels** table, and the **Stop Rules** before running any ULW command or recording evidence.
3. Open `references/define-goal.md` and register the run's goal by it. Goal creation is NEVER skipped: shape the objective and every success criterion by that reference before any implementation.
4. If the task has code edits, tests, QA, or commit work, follow the full workflow's delegation and evidence rules. Tests alone never prove done.

## Non-Negotiables

- Use the ulw-loop CLI state under `.omo/ulw-loop`; do not hand-edit goal state.
- Register goals up front, shaped by `references/define-goal.md` (`omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop create-goals`, then `create_goal` from the printed handoff), and mirror every atomic step into the live `update_plan` checklist: one ultra-granular step per action, exactly one in_progress, transitions marked the instant they happen.
- After any compaction or context loss, re-read brief + goals + ledger FIRST plus `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop status --json`, then resume; never re-plan from scratch.
- Every ulw-loop command needs the session scope: pass `--session-id <id>` (the printed handoff and resume directive carry it; `CODEX_THREAD_ID` in the environment also resolves it). The CLI refuses unscoped state (`ULW_LOOP_SESSION_SCOPE_REQUIRED`) instead of touching the shared `.omo/ulw-loop` root.
- If `omo-agent-toolkit ulw-loop create-goals` says this session's aggregate is already complete, start unrelated new work with a fresh `--session-id <new-id>` (passed on every later call) instead of steering or forcing the completed state. Use `--force` only to intentionally overwrite completed evidence.
- Every success criterion needs observable evidence from a real surface: a channel (terminal/TUI via the xterm.js web terminal, HTTP, browser, computer-use) or, for CLI- or data-shaped criteria, an auxiliary surface (CLI stdout, DB diff, parsed config dump).
- Evidence is bound to the tree it was captured at (`git rev-parse --short "HEAD^{tree}"`); it goes stale only when tracked content changes — a rebase or amend that keeps the tree identical keeps it valid. When the tree differs, re-run at the current HEAD and re-record, never relabel or regenerate. Record only after cleanup receipts exist.
- Delegate code edits, test writes, fixes, and QA execution to right-sized Codex subagents when the workflow requires it.
- Every `spawn_agent` message starts with `TASK:`, then names `DELIVERABLE`, `SCOPE`, and `VERIFY`; put role and specialty instructions inside `message`; use `fork_turns: "none"` (v1: `fork_context: false`) unless full history is truly required.
- Plan and reviewer agents may run for a long time; spawn them in the background and keep doing independent root work. Between `wait_agent` calls, back off — double the timeout up to ~5 minutes — instead of spinning short cycles.
- For work likely to exceed one wait cycle, require the child to send `WORKING: <task> - <current phase>` before long reading, testing, or review passes, and `BLOCKED: <reason>` only when it cannot progress.
- Track spawned agent names locally. Use `wait_agent` for mailbox signals, not proof of completion. A timeout only means no new mailbox update arrived. Treat a running child as alive.
- While children run, surface the active subagent count, agent names, and latest `WORKING:` phase.
- Fallback only when the child is completed without the deliverable, ack-only after `followup_task`, explicitly `BLOCKED:`, or no longer running. Then record inconclusive and respawn a smaller `fork_turns: "none"` task with the missing deliverable.
- Use `git-master` for git-tracked edits: inspect recent and touched-path commit history, then commit each verified work unit atomically in the repository's observed language, scope, and message style with only that unit's files staged. Never carry verified units into a later omnibus commit.

## Team mode: decide it, do not default to it

Solo execution with parallel background `task` workers is the default. A team (`team_create`) adds per-member briefing, shared-state, and relay overhead, so it must be paid for by the work's shape. Decide ONCE, when the plan's work units are known, and record the verdict plus its reason in the notepad.

Stand up a team when BOTH hold:

1. **The units' scopes overlap in a way you cannot cleanly cut.** They touch the same module, contract, or migration, so one unit's discovery changes what another should do. Fire-and-forget workers cannot exchange that mid-flight; teammates can, because the lead relays it.
2. **Running them at the same time actually finishes sooner.** The units are each substantial and none is merely waiting on another's output. Two units where the second only consumes the first's result are a sequence, not a team.

When the units are genuinely independent — separate files, no shared contract — spawn parallel background `task` workers instead and avoid the team coordination overhead entirely. When the work is one cohesive unit, do it yourself. Overlap alone is not enough: near-identical units that would collide on the same lines are faster done in sequence by one worker.

Under team mode, isolate and land per unit:

- **One git worktree per member**, never a shared checkout — concurrent members editing one working tree corrupt each other's diffs and evidence. Give each member its own branch off the base and its own worktree path.
- **Merge per work unit, as each unit is verified.** A member's unit lands when its own evidence is captured and its gates are green; it does not wait for the slowest sibling. Integrate each merged unit back into the base the others branch from, so overlapping members rebase onto real merged work rather than guessing at it.
- **Conflicts are the lead's job.** When two members' units touch the same lines, the lead decides the order they land and tells the later member what changed; members never resolve a sibling's conflict blind.

## Codex Tool Mapping

Codex exposes ONE subagent surface per session — check your tool list. GPT-5.6 (sol/terra) get the flat MultiAgentV2 tools (primary); GPT-5.5 and gpt-5.6-luna get the namespaced `multi_agent_v1.*` set (fallback row). The workflow's orchestration examples map to:

| Intent | MultiAgentV2 (gpt-5.6 sol/terra) |
| --- | --- |
| Spawn a worker | `spawn_agent({"task_name":"<lower_snake_id>","message":"TASK: act as <role>. ...","fork_turns":"none"})` — `task_name`+`message` required; `fork_turns:"none"` = no parent history; do NOT set `agent_type`/`model`/`reasoning_effort` |
| Re-task an idle worker (wakes it) | `followup_task({"target":"<name>","message":"..."})` |
| Send context without interrupting | `send_message({"target":"<name>","message":"..."})` |
| Wait for a mailbox signal | `wait_agent({"timeout_ms":<ms>})` — any live worker; a timeout only means no new update |
| Enumerate / stop a runaway | `list_agents()` / `interrupt_agent({"target":"<name>"})` — no `close_agent`; finished workers end on their own |

V1 fallback (gpt-5.5, gpt-5.6-luna): `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent({...,"fork_context":false})`, `multi_agent_v1.send_input` (re-task), `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent({"targets":[...],"timeout_ms":...})`, `multi_agent_v1.close_agent`.

When translating `load_skills=[...]`, include the requested skill names in the spawned agent's `message`.
